      Hello. This is the Tigerspike Playbook.

    %p.display-font.med
      Itâ€™s a resource conceived by the XD team to share our plays, which are the methods and tools we use to solve problems.
      We made it so that we can be more consistent in how we talk about our work, even as our process evolves.

    %p.display-font.med
      Think patterns, not templates. Guide, not gospel.
