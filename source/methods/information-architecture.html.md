##What is Information Architecture?
<h4 class="description">Organize and structure a product's content and information.</h4>

Information Architecture is a method — involving many sub-methods — of organizing information within a digital product. IA is part of nearly every project since, at the very least, some amount of labeling or navigation work will typically take place. However, for projects that entail a large scale reorganization of content, or that are building out a new product from scratch, a full scale IA engagement should be undertaken. This article describes a full blown IA process including testing for a redesign of an existing product.

####Why do we do it?

Information Architecture helps users feel oriented within your product. It helps them answer the following questions in the clearest, most efficient way possible:

- Where am I?
- What’s here?
- Where can I go from here?

Traditional IA recognizes that meanings and categories are highly subjective and that, therefore, assumptions about how to organize and label must be heavily validated with subject matter experts and users.

####How do I get started?

Be sure you have some KPIs (questioned and validated) against which to weigh your recommendations.

Make sure all are aligned on the expectations of content scope. Which products/sites/apps will you be surveying as part of your work? Is there a possibility of trashing existing content, or creating new content? If so, ensure you have access to the decision makers who will be validating this. You may also need access to content producers to ensure content recommendations you make are viable and sustainable.

Ensure you have access to the appropriate tech stakeholders to gain an understanding of the Content Management System (CMS) or backend so you can make a realistic recommendation with an understanding of its flexibility (or lack thereof); perhaps the site cannot be completely re-architected.

Understand the client’s appetite and budget for validating IA with actual users and SMEs.

Ensure you have access to site analytics if dealing with an existing product.

The first step in the process should always be to survey and analyze the existing content (in fact, this part of the project should happen early in the project — during Discovery, as opposed to Design). Copy one of the content audit documents, and modify it to suit the exact needs of the project you are working on.

From there forward, IA will be a process of taking a stab at a scheme, validating with users and SMEs, refining, and validating again — much like any design process. Note that design and IA will happen alongside each other and design may affect the IA as it evolves. Therefore, IA may need to be revisited throughout the project.

Break down the current content you have surveyed and analyze it.  If you find that there are issues with the current content — that some should be cut, and new content should be created — you will need to undertake a consultation with some combination of stakeholders, content producers and tech SMEs to validate your assumptions.

Once you have a clear understanding of the content for the future site, you’ll re-group it into new buckets or domains totally disconnected from the previous system. You will then work to validate and re-work against analytics, user testing (you can use card sorts), and consulting with subject matter experts.

####After you finish:

IA exercises tend to produce working documents (like spreadsheets) with content that will eventually be folded directly into design and development.
