##What is User Definition?
<h4 class="description">Create user archetypes and personas.</h4>

User archetypes and personas are types of artifacts we create when working in the Discovery phase. They are descriptions of typical (or archetypal) users of our proposed product, used to guide designers in decision making process and serve as validation when discussing those decisions. They also help to reinforce recommendations and solutions when presenting back to stakeholders and help to center the conversation around goals and needs of the customers. They are meant to be a living, breathing document that should be referenced throughout the phase and the following phases.

Earlier in our process, we may refer to these as “proto-personas”, which essentially means we’ve started to outline who we think our users are (typically during a brainstorming activity), what their behaviors, needs and goals are, but we are still researching and refining them. Once we have consensus from our stakeholders, we can begin to validate accuracy via user research and continue to further refine them. Personas and archetypes are the starting point for answering the question, "Who are we designing for?"

####Why do we do it?
Creation of user archetypes and personas is the basis of our design work. It is imperative that we as designers can step outside of our own perspectives and experiences and focus instead on the end users and their goals. Considering our user’s needs first ensures that we will base our decisions around experiences. It also helps us to avoid falling into designing solutions that match with our prior experiences.

A persona is useful because it helps you consider the goals, challenges, and experiences of your primary customers, which is, unfortunately, not information easily gathered from a survey or analytics tool. Having a set of credible personas enables us to make better decisions regarding what requirements are important. It provides a feedback loop for such question as “will people using our platform get value from this feature?” They are important because they help us build empathy, develop focus and prioritize product features.


####How do I get started?
User definition is best done with via Interviews and Contextual Inquiry with users, customer data, client stakeholders and subject matter experts. After compiling and analyzing your findings, synthesis should be done as a team, preferably with stakeholders to create alignment around goals for the product and priority areas for improvement. Consider using an Empathy Map as a way to articulate your findings around users’ thoughts and feelings.

*Use these questions to help guide your work:*

- How do users find your product?
- What task does the user need to complete?
- What job are they hiring this product to do?
- Where are they struggling in the process?
- How are we helping them meet their goals?
- What are their expectations for future features?
- How can we simplify the process?
- Where are the opportunities to improve the experience?


Step 1: Using info from workshop exercises and interviews, start by categorizing user types and the needs of each persona that was generated. Identify any overlap.

Step 2: Keep an eye out for a growing number of personas. During your brainstorming you may generate several, but you need to narrow your focus to 2-3.

Step 3: Download template <a href="">here</a>. Using the content matrix, map each user as a point on the graph.

Step 4: Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create a document for each of your proto-personas.

Step 5: Post up your personas for a team review session and discuss any edits required.

Step 6: Next, you’ll want to compare each archetype and content matrix to understand where there is overlap in commonality of intent.

Step 7: Finally, you’ll write a primary user story that will help to create simple descriptions of each user’s reason for using the product.

####After you finish:

If the persona was initially developed with singular primary input source (such as stakeholders), then it’s important to try to further validate the persona with supporting research, such as user interviews or data analysis.

Personas should be translated into a sharable format so that both the internal team and the project stakeholders can print or display to keep at top-of-mind. It’s likely you’ll also want to prepare a presentation slide for each persona, so that they can be referenced when sharing design work at reviews.


Remember personas aren’t a “once and done” tool. Review and research your personas once a quarter to ensure you always know who you are designing for.

Do this by:

    <li>Gather quantitative data through surveys, web analytics, and CRM tools to make sure your personas reflect the main user segments.</li>
    <li>Qualitative data, from interviews, focus groups, and field studies, will ensure your accurately reflect user motivations in your personas.</li>
