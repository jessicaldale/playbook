##What is a Concept Sprint?
<h4 class="description">Collaboratively brainstorm around critical business, product, and user questions.</h4>

A concept sprint is a cooperative, time-boxed learning phase where insights about users and stakeholders are compiled and analyzed to produce project ideas that can be tested in low-fi prototypes for quick validation. In a concept sprint, the group answers critical business, product, and user questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with users and stakeholders.

The theme of a concept sprint is "break it while it's cheap." The goal is to test something and have some tangible results at the end of the sprint. All of the activities during the sprint should be carried out in the service of testing ideas and hypotheses.

####Why do we do it?

Concept sprints help all stakeholders gain insights into their users and look at the design process from a user centric point of view. Idea generation comes directly from consideration of user pain points, business needs, and brand goals. Assumptions are identified and hypotheses are established so that rapid testing can be executed and concepts can pivot and morph into the solutions that make the most impact.

The objective is to generate as many ideas to solve user issues that are in-line with business goals, and prioritize those concepts into actionable solutions to test against those hypotheses.

####How do I get started?

It’s best to come in to the concept sprint with information taken from user interviews or surveys so the group can have something to work with.

Bring any assets that might help spark ideas or connect the group to their users’ pain points and moments of delight. Anything that brings the users “into the room” will help everyone work toward solutions for them, with less of their own bias clouding the process.

Creating an agenda that has clear opening, exploring, defining, and closing bookends will help concentrate the process.


Things that happen in a concept sprint with a timeframe of 5 days:

Day 1
Goal: Understand the problem/s, pick a target goal around which solutions will be designed and tested for the rest of the sprint.

- Engage with the stakeholders present to collectively decide on a long term goal for the sprint.
- Map out the challenges - identify and document touchpoints that are opportunities for improvement
- Hone in on a single target. It should be an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in the allotted sprint timeframe

Day 2:
Goal: Create solutions around the agreed upon target from day 1

- Review yesterday’s work, and make sure everyone is on the same page with the overall goal of the week and the target problem that’s on the table to solve.
- Through a collaborative exercise (see Workshop Activities for ideas), inspire the room to brainstorm real and creative solutions - always remembering to tie the solution to the root of the problem. Keep asking “is this really solving their problem?"
- Start recruiting users who will be available for testing on Day 5. Make sure to identify the users that will directly benefit from this solution. Picking users unrelated to the solution, just to test on “someone” is not ideal.

Day 3:
Goal: Refine Solutions and plan prototype/s

- Review yesterday’s work, again - revisit the overall goal. It's important to keep people focused and remember what the group is trying to achieve.
- Pick which solutions you want to take forward into testing. Which ones have the best chance of meeting your long term goal? Which ones have the most impact? Which ones are harder and need more work before testing?
- Create a user journey for each solution - formulate the hypothesis that will be tested: Make sure to formulate the hypothesis in the following format: I/we believe [user/s] will [do this action / use this solution] so they can [benefit]. An example could be:
- We believe that millennials want to print their Instagram photos so they can share with friends who are not members.


Day 4:
Goal: Create a low-fi, testable prototype for day 5

- Review the overall goal, make sure everyone feels that the group is still tracking with it.
- Create a prototype. Make it low fidelity, concentrating on the minimum amount of work to get meaningful responses/data to validate your hypothesis.
- Make sure Friday’s testing sessions are set up and ready to go.

Day 5:
Goal: Test, reflect, identify next steps

- Perform the tests, do the interviews, compile the results
- Present the results to the group in broad strokes
- Identify validations or “failures” of the prototype and decide what you need to learn next.
- Capture those next steps

####After you finish:

It’s possible after the sprint that results need to be compiled formally into a deliverable for review. Keep the deck as light as possible - the point of a Concept Sprint, where you include as many stakeholders as possible, is to spend time solving the issues and less time documenting because all the relevant parties were in the room.
