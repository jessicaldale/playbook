##What is a Workshop?
<h4 class="description">Work through business and design questions with stakeholders.</h4>

A workshop is designed to bring together project stakeholders and the Tigerspike team to identify and work through project questions up front. At the conclusion, a summary of key findings and recommendations is presented. The goal of the workshop is to gather the objectives of the key stakeholders and to understand the context in which they operate. With that context and the objectives in mind, we ideally can walk away with alignment on vision for the future of the product.

####Why do we do it?
Discovery workshops allow everyone to meet, possibly for the first time, and lay their cards on the table. Items discussed might include what aggravates them about the current product/process, questions they have about how the project will be run or what Tigerspike’s approach to design is, and, most excitingly, any ideas for how they want the engagement to work. Everyone is listened to and all comments are captured, giving the clients a real opportunity to feel heard, be on the same page, and get buy in at this early stage.

It’s also often a way for our new clients to evaluate Tigerspike, as it is generally our introduction to the stakeholders in terms of both the team and our process.

####How do I get started?
First, you need to decide on your overall objective for the workshop for both your team and the client. You may organize your agenda and activities slightly differently based on what you are trying to learn, how much time you have, or who you may want to participate.

*Use these questions to help guide your work:*

- What are the business goals and objectives?
- What are user’s needs and expectations?
- What is the vision for the product?
- What industry best practices can inform the project?
- What content and functionality is required?
- What technical solution is required?
- What are the key milestones & timeframes?

When you’ve made your decision as a team about objectives, you can create an agenda to suit the questions you’ll need to answer. You should also coordinate with a project manager to make sure a space is booked and that you have the appropriate materials for each of your activities. Workshop bag includes post-its, plenty of sharpies, voting dots, sticky tack or painter’s tape and some blank paper for sketching notes/ideas. Remember to bring a timer, too!

- Step 1: Create an agenda. Make sure the agenda is reviewed by the clients and confirm the list of participants.
- Step 2: On the day of the workshop, try to get into the room early (an hour is ideal) and set up the room for your activities.
- Step 3: During the workshop, you’ll need one person assigned to be the facilitator. Have your team support as needed.
- Step 4: See <a href="../tools/workshop-activities.html" title="Workshop activities">workshop activities</a> for more specific information on how to lead the group to produce the information you need to leave with.
- Step 5: At the end of the workshop, make sure to take pictures of all of the walls, then gather all notes/sketches from the walls and bring them back with you.

The facilitator’s job includes:

- Establishing Rules of Engagement so that people know how to participate and what is expected
- Setting the tone (one of non-judgement and fun)
- Knowing and reading the room, and giving all participants an equal voice (as much as is possible and appropriate)

####After you finish:
When you’ve finished the workshop, regroup as a team and talk about what you learned, saw, and heard. You will have enough information to begin outlining your proto-personas and some hypotheses you’ll begin to research further in this phase. Depending on the amount of time you have, you ideally will also have captured high-level requirements, a product vision, and some measures of success.

Once you’ve created your outputs, create a folder in Dropbox within the appropriate Client > Project folder, and place the file accordingly. If client facing, make sure to export a PDF of your output and upload to the project’s Basecamp. That way the project manager can find the files and share with the client.

It's important to have key stakeholders there, but keeping the number of participants down is also important for efficiency. It’s difficult to hold a conversation with more than 8 people, so if the group size is rather large, then key discussions might be best conducted in breakout groups with reporting/wrap-up done in the full group. Sometimes we have no choice and clients demand everyone be there. In those cases, this is often just as much about building trust and introducing yourself as anything else. Be thoughtful about your goals and use the time you have with Senior Level stakeholders wisely.

Build in “incubation” time for processing the workshop outputs—they often require synthesis and evaluation before turning into implementable ideas or deliverables.
