##What is Heuristic Evaluation?
<h4 class="description">Evaluate the design of a product or service.</h4>

Heuristic evaluation is a method used to evaluate user experience design including  adherence to platform and device guidelines, ease of navigation, interaction design, and the app’s place in the market. It enables expert evaluators to find usability problems within a limited period of time. Heuristic evaluation can be performed at any stage during the delivery process. That said, if a product/service already exists, conducting an evaluation at the start of a project ensures you gather feedback early on.

Heuristic evaluation is based on guidelines or heuristic principles (hence the name) that evaluators use when they evaluate a product or system. A number of heuristic components make up each principle.

####Why do we do it?
The objective of conducting a heuristic evaluation of a product is to help identify problems with individual elements and how they impact the overall user experience. There are several benefits of doing a heuristic evaluation. First, heuristic evaluation can be easier and more cost effective than other research methods (e.g. field research or in-person user research). Second, depending on what you’re evaluating, a heuristic evaluation can be relatively quick to conduct. Finally, you can conduct a heuristic evaluation before or alongside other usability testing methods.

####How do I get started?

To get started, review the heuristic evaluation brief so you know what the objectives are, and what exactly you are meant to cover during the evaluation. Next, you’ll need to define an appropriate list of heuristics. Choosing appropriate heuristics is very important. If the wrong heuristic principles are employed, certain usability problems may be overlooked. 

The first evaluation generally takes around 2-4 hours, depending on the nature and complexity of the product. You should take this time to use the product freely to gain a feel for the methods of interaction and the scope of the site. By the end of this exploration, you should be able to identify the specific elements that you want to evaluate. If possible, it’s a good idea to do a walk-through of the product with a representative from the product team (normally client-side). This will ensure that you are clear on user types, scenarios, and pathways.

In the second evaluation phase, you should carry out another run-through, while applying the chosen heuristics to the elements identified during the first phase. Try to focus on individual elements, looking at how well they fit in the overall design. As you carry out tasks and follow user flows, track and record all of the problems you encounter. Be sure to be as detailed and specific as possible when recording problems.

Each person evaluating the site should do it separately (at least two evaluators is ideal), but once you are finished, you should conduct a debriefing session to collate findings and establish a complete list of observations and problems. Once you have recorded all of the problems, suggest potential solutions on the basis of the heuristics.

####After you finish

After insights have been gathered, it’s time to offer suggestions in a prioritized manner so the client can see what’s most urgent and what can be roadmapped for the future. A sortable spreadsheet with themes, tasks, notes, and priority can be presented for each individual observation. Depending on findings, a general phased outline (or high level project roadmap) can be offered with next steps and conclusions.
