##What is Content Strategy?
<h4 class="description">Account for on the planning, creation, delivery, and governance of content.</h4>

Content Strategy is a broad method — comprising many sub-techniques and tools — to help digital product owners and editors organize, create, and sustainably plan for on-brand and design-appropriate content. Content in this context means text, images, and video.

####Why do we do it?

Content is the place where the "rubber meets the road" in design. Pie in the sky thinking comes down to earth when site owners realize how much their content may need to change to suit designs. This is because creating great content takes time, skill, and people within the organization to produce it. Therefore, it’s subject to all the messiness and internal politics of any workplace. Content Strategy is a key point where our work dips into HR and workflow, touching on management consulting.

Despite being so crucial to the success of digital products, content has historically been an afterthought in a project's process. This has led to many disastrous 11th hour scenarios right before launch. By bringing content questions into a project early, we can avoid such scenarios, really get to know our clients, and help them plan for the future.

####How do I get started?

Take a holistic look at the project to assess which aspects of content strategy make sense. It’s possible that exactly what you work on will change throughout the course of the project, but you should have at least a few ideas to start.

Content Strategy is still a relatively new aspect of web development. Think through how it will fit in with the other work going on in the project. Create a diagram that shows where you believe content strategy sits in the process and the back and forth with other roles. Communicate your vision to the project team, ask for questions and consider adjustments.

Since this is new, also be prepared to act as the representative of content strategy to the client — to explain what it is and how you will work with them.

Your process will depend completely on the project at hand. Below are a few examples. Whatever the project, the key is to take a step back and think about how a content lens can help.

  - If you are working on a retail app redesign that involves many screens of content, you may create a content register that indicates the character count for each field on each screen.
  - If you are building a new employee facing intranet, you will want to build in plenty of time for auditing the content and communicating with content producers to ensure the recommendations you make are realistic and sustainable. You might also create a content style guide so that producers and editors for the site are aligned on the substance, style, and length of the content.
  - If you are redesigning a consumer facing media website, you will want to understand how the existing content fits in with the client’s goals and KPIs.

In all of these cases, it’s important to understand the content you’re dealing with to begin, and you should likely undertake a content audit (or at least review) for nearly every project.

####After you finish:

Working with the client should be an ongoing process. Since content strategy is a new aspect to many projects, you should clearly explain your role. Consider a takeaway print out to bring to early meetings explaining what content strategy is to the client and how you plan to work together.

After you’ve finished your work, hand off all of the content strategy pieces to the client in one big file with a “start here” page explaining what each item is and how they all work together.

For anyone on the internal team, you can walk them through the project materials whether those are on Basecamp, Dropbox, Google Drive or Evernote. You could also have a lunch & learn to explain how you approached content strategy for the project.
