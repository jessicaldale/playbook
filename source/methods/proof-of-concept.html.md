##What is a Proof of Concept?
<h4 class="description">Showcase a design's key differentiators.</h4>

A Proof of Concept is a design idea that is presented to clients that outlines key differentiating opportunities for the product. Explorations might be done into the business, brand, and user goals, along with the capabilities of the current and upcoming tech landscape. It can be as small as a single interaction or form redesign, or it can be a large, big-picture brand development concept including many touchpoints in an omni-channel experience.

The end delivery to the client usually consists of both a presented and takeaway versions of a deck, plus a prototype, demo, or visual examples of what’s possible when it comes to solving their business, brand, and user goals.

####Why do we do it?

POCs provide the client with a vision into what their product or brand could become with Tigerspike’s help. Presenting the possibilities can potentially open their eyes to a bigger, more holistic solution than “do some UX to it.” It breathes life into the product's development — an energy that carries through to Implementation.

###How do I get started?

Start with a list of questions. A POC starts with research into what existing information we can use as a jumping off point to see what’s actually possible.

Gather any and all of the following items from the client:

- Brand guidelines - any visual or content related that help establish the tone of voice for the brand
- Style guide
- Pattern libraries
- Any work that’s been done previously on the target area (if work has been done and dropped off)

Ideally, the process then starts with a workshop or working session with stakeholders to identify their business and brand goals, as well as learn as much as possible about their marketplace and product strategies.

Going into the cooperative session, a sample list of questions that should be addressed include:

- What are their initial goals and interests for the brand in general?
- How do they currently see the digital world, in general?
- What does the competitor landscape look like?
- Where are digital brands are headed?
- Are there comparative features we can look at for inspiration for innovation?
- What does engagement on different platforms look like in the near future?
- How can the product or brand stay at the forefront of forward-thinking media?
- What opportunities are there for actionable experiences, and better brand engagement?
- What technology opportunities and limitations are out there to think about?

###After you finish:

The final deliverable should include answers to all of the above questions, resulting in an informed concept that’s presented to the client. The goal is to get them excited about working with Tigerspike and help encourage them to trust us with their brand.

Deliver a polished deck with a shareable version of any digital demos or prototypes. These tools help them convince other people in their organization that we are the right team for the job. It lets our allies sell us to their superiors, so arm them well.
