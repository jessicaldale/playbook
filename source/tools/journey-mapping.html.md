##What is journey mapping?
<h4 class="description">Diagram the customer experience through the individual's perspective.</h4>

A customer journey map is a visual diagram that illustrates the overall experience from an individual customer's perspective of their relationship with an organization, service, product or any combination, over time and across different touch points. <b>It should be grounded in customer research (not from a company perspective or product perspective).</b>  It is a simple visual reminder of the user research that has been conducted and analyzed.

A customer journey map can help to answer the following questions:

- What is the customer need and what have they set out to accomplish?
- What is the customer doing at each stage of an experience journey?
- What communication channels would the customer use?
- What emotions is the customer feeling?
- What are the barriers and pain points of a service?
- What are the opportunities of a service so I could improve it?

<hr />

####Why do we do it?
The objective of the customer journey map is to deconstruct a users’ experience with an organization, product or service as a series of steps and themes. Put simply, these methods encourage business stakeholders to think about user needs effectively, identifying pain points and opportunities in a systematic and straightforward way.

By producing journey maps that illustrate an optimal customer experience, we enable stakeholders and executives to identify, prioritize, and maintain focus on the changes that matter.

If used to improve a current customer experience, a current-state journey map can:

- Identify pain points and prioritize fixes
- Identify opportunities for feedback or measurement
- Plan content strategy
- Zero in on the primary causes of customer frustration

If used to drive organizational change a current-state journey map can also:

- Align business stakeholders around the customers’ point of view
- Help businesses empathize with customers
- Help business employees understand better their roles in delivering a positive customer experience

If used to envision a future customer experience, a future-state journey map can:

- Illustrate the vision for your business strategy
- Plan the roadmap of a future product or service
- Identify innovation opportunities
- Identify the infrastructure and capabilities needed to deliver on the vision

####How do I get started?

<b>Step 1: Create a high-level brief for the customer journey map including:</b>

- Purpose/Goal
- Approach (qualitative and quantitative) e.g. client or internal workshop, user interviews/contextual inquiry etc.
- Type of journey map e.g. current or future state
- User types
- User goals
- Key principles for the org/product or service
- Physical and digital channels to be considered
- Timeline
- Indicative outputs, actions and level of fidelity
- Primary client contact for approval/sign off

<b>Step 2: Subject Immersion, Prepare & Hypothesize</b>

Start by familiarizing yourself with the organization, their customer(s)/users and service offering. Conduct desk research investigating the organization, competitors, customer support and social media channels. If the product/service exists, try to obtain customer service transcripts, analytics reports etc. Review any existing information and formulate hypothesise around who the customers are, their motivations, contexts, technologies, service use and pain points.

<b>Step 3: Customer Research / Analytics Review</b>

Conduct ethnographic-style interviews and in-context observations. Ask customers to map out their journeys for you, whilst conducting primary research.
Analyze data from analytics to understand customer behavior, pathways and precise points where service issues are arising. This should be the basis of your map.
Get your whole team to participate in this research!

<b>Step 4: Create the Customer Journey Map</b>

Begin by recapping the purpose of the activity and expected outcomes. Now, walk through the components to be completed as part of the journey map: Customer / Stages / Activities (doing) / Motivations (goals) / Questions (thinking) / Emotions (feeling) / Barriers (pain points)

- Choose the customer that accounts for most of the anticipated usage/business.
- Define the stages in the customer journey from first interaction, to purchase/conversion and subsequent interactions.
- Align customer goals with the stages (data to inform goals may include user interviews, surveys, customer service transcripts)
- Identify the touchpoints and channels that move customers through each stage (data to inform channels may include google analytics)
- Identify barriers in customers achieving their goals (data to inform barriers may include analytics and qualitative research)
- Identify opportunities for change and improvement

<b>Step 5: Findings & Recommendations</b>

Finally, prioritize findings and recommendations based on user and business needs and capabilities...

You’ll want to distill your findings about how customers interact with the company, what they want from each interaction, and how they feel about each interaction today—the three key elements of a journey map.

<hr />

####After you finish:

Don’t just hand over a final artifact, communicate the learnings to your team. These are living documents that should continuously be updated based on iterative research. Journey maps bring customer needs and emotions to light by guiding stakeholders through the series of interactions customers follow to satisfy their needs. Ultimately, you want to enable stakeholders to collectively discuss opportunities for improving the overall customer experience, as well as to look within their own core groups for ideas and actions that will bring about change.
