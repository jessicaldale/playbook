##What is the Design Planning?
<h4 class="description">Prepare for and organize a design delivery.</h4>

This is the process of planning for a design phase. It involves organizing and prioritizing deliverables, assigning responsibilities, and scheduling milestones and check-ins with the client.

<hr />

####Why do we do it?

Planning will greatly benefit the internal team, and will help the client relationship. By going through the process of planning, the project leadership can more clearly communicate responsibilities, dependencies, and deadlines to the team. When setting up a schedule, you have the opportunity to establish the cadence of feedback early on with the client, and make sure to get a regular spot on their calendar for touchpoints.

####How do I get started?

The first step is to map out the order in which features should be addressed, noting dependencies and unknowns. Once you have a high-level schedule, you can start considering how work might be evenly divided. If assigning work out to a large team, it’s typically ideal to be able to pair a UX designer and a UI designer for the duration of the project, so also start considering team pairings when scheduling workload.

The next step is to capture the features and tasks in a system that’s accessible by all members of the team. This helps facilitate team communication and understanding of the big picture. A system like Trello allows you to create and assign tickets, and move them along in a process, so that it’s easy to see progress at a glance. When setting up a board for a project, here are some things to consider:

- Make a space for stashing future ideas (parking lot)
- Acknowledge all steps in the approval process (what internal approvals are needed? How many levels of client approval are needed?)

The board should become the day-to-day working space for the team and the primary place for communication. By assigning tasks in the system, it’s easy for individual members of the team to review their workload.

####After you finish:

The documents you set up should be shared with the internal team, and potentially with the client. They should be continually updated to reflect changes and indicate progress.
