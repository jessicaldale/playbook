##What are workshop activities?
<h4 class="description">Facilitate different ways of thinking.</h4>

Workshop activities are different exercises that can be done with clients (or in some cases, with the internal team) in order to orient, examine, explore, or narrow thinking.


<hr />

####Why do we do it?

Workshop activities are arranged in a time boxed schedule and are meant to engage, guide, and empower participants to become part of the design process, resulting in a deeper and more complex user-based understanding of the problem and solution space.

<hr />

####How do I get started?

In order to choose the right workshop activities, you first need to recognize what type of information you’re looking for, which is often tied to where you and your team is in the design process.

<ul>
  <li><u>Orientation:</u> Warm ups, Energizers, Icebreakers; activities that get participants in the right frame of mind to let go of inhibitions and do deeper, divergent thinking </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><u>Examine:</u> Activities that dig into the problem, provide deeper understanding, and identify opportunity areas</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><u>Explore:</u> Ideation and brainstorming activities; combining and building on insights to make new, interesting connections</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><u>Narrow:</u> Convergent thinking, organizing thoughts, and narrowing down the options with which to move forward</li>
</ul>


Based on the type of information or thinking that is needed, time allotted, and what is known about the participants (some activities might be more successful for certain groups than others), select your workshop activities. Make a slide deck with the instructions for each activity, and gather the necessary supplies.

<i>Below is a list of activities sorted by type. Those most recently used by the TS AMER team are indicated with an asterisk (*).</i>


<u>Orientation</u>

  - Team trading cards (icebreaker)
  - Personal coat of arms (icebreaker)
  - Sketching Warm-ups (warm-up)
  - Rock/Paper/Scissors Tournament (energizer)

  - Journey Mapping (understand beyond a specific product)
  - Empathy Map (understand the user)*
  - Story Mapping*
  - Job Mapping
  - Project Landscape
  - Personas*
  - Bad Ideas//Good Ideas (mores specific ideas; shake out of a rut)

<u>Explore</u>

  - Creative Matrix (broad swath brainstorming)
  - Association with a phrase/word/image
  - Physical Object
  - Pass the Sketch

<u>Narrow</u>

  - Ask “why” 5 times
  - Product hierarchy
  - Dot voting*

####After you finish:

Activity outcomes should be documented in photos and saved artifacts. Workshop outcomes require additional analysis—see the article on how to conduct a <a href="/methods/workshop.html">Workshop</a> for more info.
