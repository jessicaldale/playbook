##What are user flows?
<h4 class="description">Map the pages and elements that allow a user to accomplish their objectives.</h4>

A user flow is a deliverable that details step-by-step the pages and elements required to allow the user and the business to accomplish their objectives.

User flows are typically created between the ideation and design phase—they can serve as the bridge between the two. At this point, there should be a solid understanding of the users and their needs, as well as a clearly defined vision for the experience.

####Why do we do this?
Designing user flows keeps you out of the trap of designing individual pages and interactions, and instead focused on fulfilling users’ needs by considering the full system in which they’re accomplishing tasks. As a clear vision of the efforts and steps required to complete a job, user flows are good for analyzing the efficiency of user tasks. User flows also help developers understand how the system interacts with user behavior.

####How do I get started?
Once you have a clear understanding of business objectives and your users’ behaviors, needs and goals, you’re ready to start capturing user flows.

Step 1: Starting with your primary persona and their key tasks, lay out a sequence of steps from entering the site to accomplishing the desired goal.
Make sure that your flow has a visible entry point and pathway which clearly reinforces for users the ability to achieve their desired outcome.

Step 2: Repeat step 1 for each targeted persona.

####After you finish:

While often created initially on a whiteboard, user flows are typically redrawn digitally and either incorporated in wireframe documentation as a framing piece, or presented as a stand alone artifact.
