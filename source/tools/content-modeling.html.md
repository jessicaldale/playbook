##What is a content model?
<h4 class="description">Describe a product's content types, and the structures that connect them.</h4>
A model, diagram, or table that describes the different types of content provide by a product, the contents of those pieces of content, and the relationships and structures that connect them.

####Why do we do it?
Content modeling can help the project and client team understand the types of content that should be designed, built, and maintained, and the relationships and structures that piece them together to make a holistic user experience. Content modeling is a practice that will give you a clear representation of your content in order to better guide you as you write, edit, design templates, configure content management systems, and more.

####How do I get started?

Understand your content types: what are the actual things users want to read or use on the product? At a high-level, what have users come here to do and what things are being offered?  Are we producing research articles, blog posts, videos, topic pages, etc? List these things out.

There are several ways to determine what your content types are and it all depends on the type of project and where you are in the process. If it's a redesign, figure out your content types through a simple content audit of the existing product. If starting from scratch, or nearly starting from scratch, try a workshop with your client to gather high-level requirements. High level requirements, especially content requirements, are a great place to start dividing out your productâ€™s content types. Your initial requirements should include the things your client wants to provide to users through their product.



<b>Step 1. Put the pieces on the board</b>

Draw or list out your content types.

<b>Step 2. Make Connections</b>

Using pen and paper (or tool of choice), start drawing connections between these content types. With each connection, describe how they are connected (e.g. Recipe Articles are related to Chef Bios by the chef who created the recipe). This exercise will help inform bottom-up information architecture and navigation design for your product.

<b>Step 3. Get Detailed</b>

For each content type, go a bit deeper and list out the elements or ingredients that make up the content type. These details can come from research, brainstorming sessions, or additional content requirement sessions with client stakeholders. Remember, new content elements might be inspired and created through the visual design process. Your content model will always grow and change as you iterate on the product.

Using a simple bulleted list, or even a table or spreadsheet, list out the elements and sub-elements that make up the entire content type and write any notes you think might be appropriate to understand about each element.

Notes to consider:

- Is the element copy static or dynamic?
- Who edits the content element?
- Where does the element copy or data come from?

####After you finish:

After you finish you should have a high-level map, diagram, or sketch of all the major content types and connections you want to draw between them, as well as a more detailed table or list of content elements that make up each content type.

Along with your designs, these items will serve as a guide to how your designs will be produced and maintained either in a database or CMS structure.
