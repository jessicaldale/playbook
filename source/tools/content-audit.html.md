##What is a Content Audit?
<h4 class="description">Evaluate the current state of content.</h4>

A Content Audit is a process used to inventory and evaluate the current state of content, and serves as a benchmark and point of departure for design during Define and Design phases. It involves going through a site and compiling a list of every content item it contains, including page names, URLs, hierarchy, assets, and owners.

By capturing current content items, the content audit serves as a foundation to develop an Information Architecture, and to make future-state decisions, such as informing future content and publication models. It should be revisited regularly and used as a tool for evaluating the existing content against the design objectives. This assessment directly informs content strategy and information architecture.

####Why do we do it?
We perform a content audit to help uncover patterns, to use as a basis for gap analysis, and to better understand lifecycle/workflow of content creation. The audit can document the volume (quantitative), quality (qualitative) and rules of use, as well as systems in which content resides and its creators. In some cases, an audit may also be used to determine targeted audience(s).

It’s primarily used by design teams to gather information about the product and understand structural relationships, but can be a helpful conversation tool when clients need a clearer picture of how their product is organized, how it communicates with users, and where there are undefined areas or many owners.

####How do I get started?
When starting a new project, ask yourself what you need to learn about the existing content.

Step 1: To begin the content audit, you’ll want to start listing the main pages or sections.

Step 2: To start evaluating a section, begin capturing raw data (for example title, URL, file format, etc.) for each piece of content, as well as its hierarchical relationships with other pieces of content and the site/product as a whole. The data being captured is dependent on the project and your goals for the audit.

Step 3: Once you’ve captured the raw data for a piece of content, you’ll want to do analysis on it and record your thoughts as comments next to the raw data. This process will uncover a number of insights, often including things like pages to be removed, content requiring revision, gaps in content, and revisions to content mapping/location.

Step 4: Continue through each piece of content within a section before moving onto the next one.

The content audit should set out to capture the following (minimum):

- a list of all the unique pages and repeated page types on the site
- the content elements contained in each page (focus on the content topic, not the implementation or design of the content)
- the approximate shape, volume, and significance of each element (is it a header or a whole paragraph)
- the navigation path to each page (from the global navigation)
- any notable functionality or description needed for a page or an element
- links and elements included in global components like headers and footers

Other notable things to capture:

- who owns and updates each page or any applicable element
- when was it updated last
- how frequently is it updated
- what metadata is associated with a page or applicable element

####After you finish:
After completing the audit, you’ll want to share key insights with stakeholders, and use your findings to guide the Define and Design phases. It may be time to schedule a Content Workshop with clients to discuss how content will be managed by owners you’ve identified and who will own the writing/editing process.

Visualizing your insights, either through charts/graphs or screenshots, will help with communicating concepts.
